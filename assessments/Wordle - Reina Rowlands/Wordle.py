""" Wordle is a game where the player tries to guess a 5-letter word. The player has 6 attempts to guess the word.
After each attempt the player will receive a score for each letter based on if the letter is in the target word and
if the position is correct. â¬œ(0) = incorrect letter ðŸŸ¨(1) = correct letter, wrong position ðŸŸ©(2) = correct letter,
correct position
